                <p>Accel is our entry class car. It went through multiple design iterations itself, and there were
                    many more versions before this design, such as 'Sprint' and 'Jump'. In CFD testing there were no
                    severe areas of low pressure, resulting in such a low drag. This design was much better than any
                    design we thought we were capable of, and we were proud of it.</p>

                    <h2>Team Formed - August 2021</h2>
                    <p>WΔRP was formed on August 2021. Originally it contained 5 (different) members - Abhinav M, Aneeq
                        W, Aritro D, Dennis E, and Neal Y. Three of these members are still part of the team to this
                        day.</p>

                    <p>Ashvin A leaves the team, and no one joins the team to fill in his role. This is because we felt
                        it wouldn't be good to add a new member so soon before regionals.</p>

                    <h2>Entry Class Regionals - 1st March 2023</h2>
                    <p>We competed in the London North regionals. Despite some slow reaction times, we still win fastest
                        car, and also best engineered car. This is a testament to how optimised our entry class is.
                        Thanks to our high quality portfolio and verbal presentation, we also win first place.</p>

                    <p>Dennis E leaves the team. As we would be moving into Dev class next season, we decide to add two
                        new members. They are Michael Q and Thomas H.</p>

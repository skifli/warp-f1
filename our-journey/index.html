                    <h2>Team Formed - August 2021</h2>
                    <p>WΔRP was formed on August 2021. Originally it contained 5 (different) members - Abhinav M, Aneeq
                        W, Aritro D, Dennis E, and Neal Y. Three of these members are still part of the team to this
                        day.</p>

                    <p>Ashvin A leaves the team, and no one joins the team to fill in his role. This is because we felt
                        it wouldn't be good to add a new member so soon before regionals.</p>

                    <p>We competed in the London North regionals. Despite some slow reaction times, we still win fastest
                        car, and also best engineered car. This is a testament to how optimised our entry class is.
                        Thanks to our high quality portfolio and verbal presentation, we also win first place.</p>

                        new members. They are Michael Q and Thomas H.</p>

                        for free. This enabled us to refine our car designs even more than before.</p>

                        we still came out on top. We also won the Research & Development award for all classes, and were
                        nominated for the Portfolio and Team Identity award. This means that we are going to compete in
                        the UK National Finals later this year!</p>

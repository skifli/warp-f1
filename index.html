                <p>When I first heard of the F1iS competition, I found it compelling and quickly formed a team. I never
                    knew that it would become such a deep and demanding project at the start, but it is something that I
                    truly enjoy and value. The feeling of winning is something you can't beat, and I want to help my
                    team on its journey.</p>

                <p>F1iS has always sounded like an amazing stem project, and as an avid DT enthusiast I knew that it was
                    the right decision to partake. Free time is also very hard to fill, and I knew F1iS would make that
                    time well spent. I also love the adrenalin rush that comes with winning, and I hope to share that
                    feeling with my teammates.</p>

                <p>F1iS seems like an awesome, incredibly fun, and difficult project that I can use to challenge myself.
                    It gives me an opportunity to learn new skills and work to my best. Although my job is not on the
                    car itself, I would love to see through its development and hopefully help throughout.</p>

                <p>I've always taken a liking towards motorsports (especially F1), and when I heard of F1iS I knew this
                    was a perfect opportunity for me. The concept of racing a miniature car along a 20m track captured
                    my interest immediately. Being a part of a team and seeing its growth throughout the years feels
                    awesome!</p>

                    my career path. Although there are a few aspects of technology and engineering that I have explored
                    in depth, F1iS is new to me, and I hope I can learn new things about it and help my team along our
                    journey.</p>

                        W, Aritro D, Dennis E, and Neal Y. Three of these members are still part of the team to this

                        we still came out on top. We also won the Research & Development award for all classes, and were
                        nominated for the Portfolio and Team Identity award. This means that we are going to compete in
                        the UK National Finals later this year!</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            WΔRP is a team of four 13-14 year-old boys from Saint Olave's Grammar
            School, who are competing in the F1 in Schools competition as an entry
            class team. We are a team of leaders, innovators, and designers who are
            ready to compete in this year's competition. We love STEM based
            activities, since we believe they provide valuable, real-life experience
            through hands-on-learning.

                As the team manager, I kept the team on top of deadlines and made sure everyone was doing their assigned
                jobs. I worked with Neal to create initial sketches of the car, and to design, test, and manufacture it.
                Due to this, I also helped to write the testing and manufacturing slides of the portfolio.

                As the portfolio manager, I oversaw the creation of the portfolio to make sure the designn scheme was
                enforced consistently. I designed the logo, and colour scheme for our team. As IT manager I also
                designed the website for our team and handled the storage and sorting of all our online files.

                As my main role was on the portfolio, my job was not only to get the necessary content on there, but
                also to make sure that it was top quality. As financing manager, I also had to handle material,
                manufacturing, and merchandise costs for our team. On top of that, I oversaw the process of obtaining
                sponsorships for our team.

                My main role was on the creation and graphic representation of our car. I made sure that the car passed
                all the required tests and was legal. I was also in charge of all the graphical elements such as the
                renders of the car and initial sketches of our car. This included creating and providing renders of the
                car for our website.

        <p>The F1 in Schools challenge is a STEM based, team challenge, targeted at all students between the ages of 9
            and 19. The event provides the participating teams with the opportunity to use CAD / CAM software to design,
            analyse, manafacture, test, and eventually race minituare compressed air powered cars. The cars are raced on
            a 20m track, and the teams are not only judged by the speed of their car, but also on their portfolios,
            marketing, verbal presentations, pit display, and more.</p>

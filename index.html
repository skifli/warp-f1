        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>WΔRP is a team of four 13-14 year-old boys from Saint Olave's Grammar School, who are competing in the F1 in
            Schools competition as an entry class team. We are a team of leaders, innovators, and designers who are
            ready to compete in this year's competition. We love STEM based activities, since we believe they provide
            valuable, real-life experience through hands-on-learning. <a href="" target="_blank">Read More...</a></p>

                <h3>Abhinav Malladi</h3>

                <p>As the team manager, I kept the team on top of deadlines and made sure everyone was doing their
                    assigned jobs. I worked with Neal to create initial sketches of the car, and to design, test, and
                    manufacture it. Due to this, I also helped to write the testing and manufacturing slides of the
                    portfolio.

                <p>As the portfolio manager, I oversaw the creation of the portfolio to make sure the designn scheme was
                    enforced consistently. I designed the logo, and colour scheme for our team. As IT manager I also
                    designed the website for our team and handled the storage and sorting of all our online files.

                <p>My main role was on the creation and graphic representation of our car. I made sure that the car
                    passed all the required tests and was legal. I was also in charge of all the graphical elements such
                    as the renders of the car and initial sketches of our car. This included creating and providing
                    renders of the car for our website.</p>

        <h2>F1 in Schools</h2>

        <p>The F1 in Schools challenge is a STEM based, team challenge, targeted at all students between the ages of 9
            and 19. The event provides the participating teams with the opportunity to use CAD / CAM software to design,
            analyse, manafacture, test, and eventually race minituare compressed air powered cars. The cars are raced on
            a 20m track, and the teams are not only judged by the speed of their car, but also on their portfolios,
            marketing, verbal presentations, pit display, and more. <a href="https://www.f1inschools.co.uk/"

                <p>When I first heard of the F1iS competition, I found it compelling and quickly formed a team. I never
                    knew that it would become such a deep and demanding project at the start, but it is something that I
                    truly enjoy and value. The feeling of winning is something you can't beat, and I want to help my
                    team on its journey.</p>

                <h4>Sponsorship & Marketing Manager</h4>
                <p>F1iS has always sounded like an amazing stem project, and as an avid DT enthusiast I knew that it was
                    the right decision to partake. Free time is also very hard to fill, and I knew F1iS would make that
                    time well spent. I also love the adrenalin rush that comes with winning, and I hope to share that
                    feeling with my teammates.</p>

                <p>F1iS seems like an awesome, incredibly fun, and difficult project that I can use to challenge myself.
                    It gives me an opportunity to learn new skills and work to my best. Although my job is not on the
                    car itself, I would love to see through its development and hopefully help throughout.</p>

                <p>I've always taken a liking towards motorsports (especially F1), and when I heard of F1iS I knew this
                    was a perfect opportunity for me. The concept of racing a miniature car along a 20m track captured
                    my interest immediately. Being a part of a team and seeing its growth throughout the years feels
                    awesome!</p>

                    my career path. Although there are a few aspects of technology and engineering that I have explored
                    in depth, F1iS is new to me, and I hope I can learn new things about it and help my team along our
                    journey.</p>

        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>WΔRP is a team of five 13-14 year-old boys from Saint Olave's Grammar School, who are competing in the F1 in
            Schools competition as a dev class team. We are a team of leaders, innovators, and designers who are
            ready to compete in this year's competition. We love STEM based activities, since we believe they provide
            valuable, real-life experience through hands-on-learning. <a href="about-us/?id=we-are-warp"

        <h2>F1 in Schools</h2>

        <p>The F1 in Schools challenge is a STEM based, team challenge, targeted at all students between the ages of
            9
            and 19. The event provides the participating teams with the opportunity to use CAD / CAM software to
            design,
            analyse, manafacture, test, and eventually race minituare compressed air powered cars. The cars are
            raced on
            a 20m track, and the teams are not only judged by the speed of their car, but also on their portfolios,
            marketing, verbal presentations, pit display, and more. <a href="https://www.f1inschools.co.uk/"

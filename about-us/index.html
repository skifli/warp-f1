                <p>We are a team of 5 boys from Saint Olave's Grammar School. STEM projects are a great way to have fun
                    while expanding your skillset, and F1 in Schools always appealed to us as an amazing way to do so.
                    While
                    we did consider Vex Robotics as well, we all knew that F1 in Schools was our calling.</p>

                <h2>Our Achievements</h2>

                <p>From winning entry class, to also getting fastest car and best engineered, our team has never
                    disappointed, with a plethora of awards to show for our hard and dedicated work. We hope to carry
                    this
                    momentum into Dev class, where we are planning to continue into the UK Nationals, and if all goes to
                    plan, even Worlds.</p>

                        When I first heard of the F1iS competition, I found it
                        compelling and quickly formed a team. I never knew that it would become such a deep and
                        demanding project at the start, but it is something that I truly enjoy and value. The
                        feeling of winning is something you can't beat, and I want to help my team on its
                        journey.

                        F1iS has always sounded like an amazing stem project, and as an avid DT enthusiast I knew that
                        it
                        was
                        the right decision to partake. Free time is also very hard to fill, and I knew F1iS would make
                        that
                        time well spent. I also love the adrenalin rush that comes with winning, and I hope to share
                        that
                        feeling with my teammates.

                        F1iS seems like an awesome, incredibly fun, and difficult project that I can use to challenge
                        myself. It gives me an opportunity to learn new skills and work to my best. Although my job is
                        not on the car itself, I would love to see through its development and hopefully help
                        throughout.

                        I've always taken a liking towards motorsports (especially F1), and when I heard of F1iS I knew
                        this was a perfect opportunity for me. The concept of racing a miniature car along a 20m track
                        captured my interest immediately. Being a part of a team and seeing its growth throughout the
                        years feels awesome!

                        I enjoy various aspects of DT, and view F1iS as a way to challenge myself in a way that could
                        benefit my career path. Although there are a few aspects of technology and engineering that I
                        have explored in depth, F1iS is new to me, and I hope I can learn new things about it and help
                        my
                        team along our journey.

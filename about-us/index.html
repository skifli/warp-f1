        <h2>We are WΔRP</h2>

        <p>We are a team of 5 boys from Saint Olave's Grammar School. STEM projects are a great way to have fun while
            expanding your skillset, and F1 in Schools always appealed to us as an amazing way to do so. While we did
            consider Vex Robotics as well, we all knew that F1 in Schools was our calling.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="our-achievements" class="middle">
        <h2>Our Achievements</h2>

        <p>From winning entry class, to also getting fastest car and best engineered, our team has never dissapointed,
            with a plethora of awards to show for our hard and dedicated work. We hope to carry this momentum into Dev
            class, where we are planning to continue into the UK Nationals, and if all goes to plan, even Worlds. <a

                <p>When I first heard of the F1s competition, I found it compelling and quickly formed a team. I never
                    knew that it would become such a deep and demanding project at the start, but it is something that I
                    truly enjoy and value. The feeling of winning is something you can't beat, and I want to help my
                    team on its journey.</p>

                <p>F1s has always sounded like an amazing stem project, and as an avid DT enthusiast I knew that it was
                    the right decision to partake. Free time is also very hard to fill, and I knew F1s would
                    make that time well spent. I also love the adrenalin rush that comes with winning, and I hope to
                    share that feeling with my teammates.</p>

                <p>F1s seems like an awesome, incredibly fun, and also difficult project that I can use to
                    challenge myself. I feel it will give me an opportunity to new skills and work to my best. Although
                    my job is not on the car, I would love to see through its
                    development and hopefully chime in throughout!</p>

                <p>I've always taken a liking towards motorsports (especially F1), and when I heard of F1s I knew this
                    was a perfect opportunity for me. The concept of racing a miniature car along a 20m track captured
                    my interest immediately. Being a part of a team and seeing its growth throughout the years feels
                    awesome!</p>

                <p>I enjoy various aspects of DT, and view F1s as a way to challenge myself in a way that could benefit
                    my career path. Although there are a few aspects of technology and engineering that I have explored
                    in depth, F1s is new to me and I hope I can learn new things about it, and help my team along our
                    journey.</p>
